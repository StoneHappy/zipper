Zipper
------

This is the manual for "zipper", a program for combining range images
into a polygonal mesh.  Zipper was specifically created to more fully
use range images acquired from a Cyberware range scanner.  With
appropriate file conversion, however, there is nothing preventing the
use of zipper with range images taken with other scanners.

The research results from the "zipper" program are described in the
following article:
